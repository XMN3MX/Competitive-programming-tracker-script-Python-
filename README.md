I created this script using some AI tools and basic Python knowledge to help competitive programmers track their spent time practicing and solving problems during this time. 
The files contain the script code and another file called Docs that help to setup the script attaching it to ur own google sheets file.
If you have any suggestions to improve the script or to improve the process, please don't hisitate to contact me.
